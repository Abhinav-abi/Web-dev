<hr>
<p><strong>Random forest</strong> is a commonly-used <u>machine learning</u> algorithm trademarked <i>by</i> Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler, which combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result. Its ease of use and flexibility have fueled its adoption, as it handles both classification and regression problems.</p>

<p>Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning technique.<br> It can be used for both Classification and Regression problems in ML.<br> It is based on the concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model.</p> */
